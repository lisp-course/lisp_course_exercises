Workflow
=================================

Typically, scientific and engineering computation starts with input values and computes values or properties of an object, uses those as inputs to compute more values and properties, and eventually produces an output.  Sometimes it is necessary to examine the intermediate values, for research, education, or debugging; sometimes, especially when doing production runs, the variable input and output are the only things of interest, the values that remain unchanged with each calculation are recorded but are not the focus of the computation, and the intermediate values are only need temporarily to get to the next stage of the computation. This describes definitions meant to aid in this process.

.. note::

   At present, very little is written; only parameters_ definitions exist, and these are likely to change.
