@deffn {Function} {grid:normalize} grid @&optional threshold
@findex grid:normalize
Find the normalized grid, i.e., each element is divided by grid
   norm, and the normalization factor.  If the norm is less than the
   non-nil threshold, then nil is returned; if it is zero and
   threshold is nil, a zero grid is returned.
