@findex antik:see-values
If keyword is in *pedagogical*, then print returned value of form,
   and return it; otherwise, just evaluate the form and return.
   If skipping-compute is true, forms are evaluated left to right,
   whether or not the keyword is in *pedagogical*.
   If it is false, they are only evaluated if keyword is in *pedagogical*, 
   and the last one is returned from this form.
