@deffn {Function} {antik:norm-denorm-angle} angle function @&optional positive
@findex antik:norm-denorm-angle
Normalize an angle, process it, and denormalize it back to the
   original cycle count.  This is useful for e.g. Kepler's equation,
   where the normalized angle is needed to for the algorithm to
   converge properly, but the full cycles are needed for f @code{&} g functions.
