@deffn {Function} {(setf grid:diagonal)}
@findex (setf grid:diagonal)
Set a subgrid where the two indices are equal or 
   differ by the offset, e.g. the diagonal affi for the matrix.
   The offset specifies sub- (offset<0) or super- (offset>0)
   diagonals.  If grid is not supplied, a grid of one higher
   dimension than diagonal with default element @code{0} is used.
