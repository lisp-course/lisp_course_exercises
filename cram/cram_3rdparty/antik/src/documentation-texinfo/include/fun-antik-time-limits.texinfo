@deffn {Function} {antik:time-limits} time1 time2 @&optional reference
@findex antik:time-limits
Make sense of time1 and time2 in absolute terms. If one is absolute,
   and the other relative, it is presumed to be relative to the other. 
   If they are both relative, they are presumed to be relative to reference.
