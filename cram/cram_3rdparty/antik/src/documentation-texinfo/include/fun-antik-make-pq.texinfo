@findex antik:make-pq
Make a physical dimension quantity (PDQ).  Allow for the
   possiblity that magnitude is already a @code{pdq}; in this case, check
   that the physical dimension is correct, and pass it on.  This can
   be used as a way of assigning default units to a number. Unitless dimensions (e.g., 'length) are
   interpeted as units in the :system-of-units.  If scalar-dimension is @code{t} and
   magnitude is not a scalar, the unit-expression applies to each
   element of the magnitude.  Otherwise it must be a grid or list of
   the shape as the magnitude.
