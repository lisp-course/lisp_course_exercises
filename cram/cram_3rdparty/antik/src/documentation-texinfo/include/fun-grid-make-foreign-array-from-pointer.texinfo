@findex grid:make-foreign-array-from-pointer
Given a foreign pointer to an array, make a Lisp object of 
   class 'foreign-array that references that.  This will never
   make a static-vector.  If finalize is true, than the array
   memory will be freed when this object is garbage collected;
   otherwise it is presumed that the foreign code will handle
   that job.
