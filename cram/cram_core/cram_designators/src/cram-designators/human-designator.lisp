(in-package :desig)

;;;
;;; CRAM resolves human designators in the same way it resolves object designators:
;;;                          Through perception routines.
;;;
;;; As a result, there are no generator functions to produce hypothetical solutions
;;; for human designators in this package. Instead, perception routines have to set
;;; the `data' slot of a human designator which they were asked to perceive. In line
;;; with this thinking, the default implementation of `resolve-designator' for human
;;; designators throws an error.
;;;
;;; When calling `reference' on an unresolved human designator will throw an error
;;; because we consider it an error to reference the low-level data slot associated
;;; with an unperceived human.
