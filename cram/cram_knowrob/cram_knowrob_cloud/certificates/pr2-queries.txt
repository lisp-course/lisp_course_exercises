Step 1: Opening fridge
======================

<handle robust pose> = handle position + orientation based on robot (z), hinge (y) 
<hinge robust pose> = robot (z), negative handle (y)

PR2 pose:
- Input parameters: distance between handle and hinge (how far robot stands), [height of door (only for torso)], [handle left or right of hinge in robot coordinates (for which direction to open) == handle in robot base and joint link in robot base]
- Output: gaussian w.r.t. <handle robust pose>

Opening trajectory:
- Input: arm used, distance between handle and hinge (radius of trajectory), [handle left or right of hinge in robot coordinates (for which direction to open) == handle in robot base and joint link in robot base]
- Output: coordinate of _arm_ tool frame in <handle robust pose>, intermediate coordinates of _arm_ tool frame in old <handle robust pose> based on particular _arm_

Pushing door open trajectory:
- Input: arm used, [handle left or right of hinge in robot coordinates (for which direction to open) == handle in robot base and joint link in robot base]
- Output: trajectory in open state <handle robust pose>

PR2 approach open fridge pose:
- Input: [handle left or right of hinge in robot coordinates (for which direction to open) == handle in robot base and joint link in robot base]
- Output: gaussian or pose w.r.t. <hinge robust pose>

Grasping object grasping pose:
- Input: arm used
- Output: tool frame in object coordinate system (oTg)

Closing trajectory:
- Input: arm used, [handle left or right of hinge in robot coordinates (for which direction to open) == handle in robot base and joint link in robot base]
- Output: trajectory in old closed <handle robust pose>
